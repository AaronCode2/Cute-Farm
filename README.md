#  How To Compile

###  Hopefully you have a **C++ Compiler**, **CMake** and **VsCode** installed to work.

1.  Download as a Zip or use Git
2.  Open the Project with Vscode and install the C/C++ Extension Pack
3.  It should come with a option of what Compiler to use, use the compiler that fits you (a GCC is recommended)
4.  Once done, open the Terminal in this directory or you could use the built-in one in Vscode.
5.  Check if Cmake has created the build file or you have done it wrong ‚ùå
6.  Type this command

        cmake --build build
